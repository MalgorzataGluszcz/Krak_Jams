## Bloody Roots - My first game on the KrakJam23 with a team 
  It's the first game I made with the team on the KrakJam23. The theme was roots so we had to think about what we do. We decide to make a bloody roots which kills people and feed the roots heart in case to live. The art to the game made Lila and I and the programming side of the game made Szymon. Music made Victor.
